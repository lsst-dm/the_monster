The LSST throughputs (version 1.9) were downloaded from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsst/throughputs/main/baseline/ on
2023-11-03.

The ComCam throughputs were assembled by combining version 1.9 of
lsst/throughputs "lens1", "lens2", "lens3", "m1", "m2", "m3", and "atmos_std"
components with the ITL throughput average as ingested into
`$OBS_LSST_DATA_DIR/comCam/transmission_sensor/r22_s10` (note that all sensors
were assumed to be the same as of 2024-12-12. Then this combined throughput was
multipled by the reference filter curves in
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsst/throughputs/main/baseline/.

The DES throughputs were downloaded from
https://noirlab.edu/science/sites/default/files/media/archives/documents/scidoc1884.txt
on 2023-11-03.
